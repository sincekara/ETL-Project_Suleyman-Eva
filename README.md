# ETL-Project (Extract, Transform and Load)

# Guidelines for ETL Project:

## Team Effort

Due to the short timeline, teamwork will be crucial to the success of this project! Work closely with your team through all phases of the project to ensure that there are no surprises at the end of the week.

## Finding Data

Your project must use 2 or more sources of data. We recommend the following sites to use as sources of data:
* [data.world](https://data.world/)
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
You can also use APIs or data scraped from the web. However, get approval from your instructor first. Again, there is only a week to complete this!

## Data Cleanup & Analysis
Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:
* The sources of data that you will extract from.
* The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).
* The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).
* The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.
You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.

## Project Report
At the end of the week, your team will submit a Final Report that describes the following:
* **E**xtract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).
* **T**ransform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.
* **L**oad: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
Please upload the report to Github and submit a link to Bootcampspot.

## Project Outcomes
A detailed project report can be found in a world file "ETL Project Report" in the project repository.
